# DarkEarthLauncher

Injection code and Windows Forms Launcher so Dark Earth runs without CD access, and on machines with no optical drives.

Compatiblity of Dark Earth :
- ddrawCompat 0.2.1 needed on Windows Vista and later
- Windows 95 compatibility mode needed on Windows Vista and later
- On Windows 10, Dark Earth needs the compatibility shim ForceDirectDrawEmulation instead of the Windows 95 compatibility mode.

If all that fails, it works well enough inside the PCem emulator too (tested config : Pentium 75, S3 Trio 64, Windows 95 OSR2, 16 MB RAM, SoundBlaster 16, 640x480 24 BPP display mode)
