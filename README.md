# DarkEarthLauncher

Injection code and Windows Forms Launcher so Dark Earth runs without CD access, and on machines with no optical drives.

Compatiblity of Dark Earth :
- ddrawCompat 0.2.1 needed on Windows Vista and later
- Windows 95 compatibility mode needed on Windows Vista and later
- On Windows 10, Dark Earth needs the compatibility shim ForceDirectDrawEmulation instead of the Windows 95 compatibility mode.

If all fails, it works well enough inside the PCem emulator too (tested config : Pentium 75, S3 Trio 64, Windows 95 OSR2, 16 MB RAM, SoundBlaster 16, 640x480 24 BPP display mode)
